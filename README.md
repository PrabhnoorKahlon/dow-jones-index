We have taken into consideration the adjusted closing price to forecast the values as it uses the closing price as a starting point, but it takes into account factors such as dividends, stock splits and new stock offerings to determine a value.

The dataset is from yahoo finance .Its a monthly data of adjusted close  from january 2000 to december 2018.
